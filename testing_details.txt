TEST PLAN
Scope : Employee CSV Data
Objective: Validate Structure, Quality, and Business rules
Tools: Python, Pandas, Pytest

TEST SUITE:
1: Structural validation - schema validation
2: Data quality validation - integrity checks
3: Business rules validation - Domain validation


1: Structural suite - schema validation:
Test cases:
- Does csv load ?
- Are required columns present ?
- Is salary numeric ? 

2: Data quality suite - integrity checks:
Test cases:
- No missing names
- Salary is positive 
- ID is unique 

3: Business-rule suite - Domain validation:
Test cases:
- Architects earn at least 90k 
- No one earns below 50k 
- Only known departments exist 


Mapping between tests and Pytest:
Test suite - test file
test case - test function 
assertion - assert (mtkiceba, damtkiceba (Georgian translation, don't mind me))
test data - CSV 
setup - fixture 

Example:
"Does every ID appear only once ?"
    assert df["ID"].is_unique

___________________-

You must prove the file loads

Only then check columns

Only then check data

Only then check business rules
